# K-BOT Hackathon code to move an arm

You will need python 3.11 to run this code (last version of kos needs that).


## Installation

Create a virtual environment.

Install all the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you change the ROBOT_IP with the IP of the raspberry pi that is running the
kos server.

## Usage

```bash
python bigboy.py
```

You should be able to move the robot arm by pressing the arrow keys.
